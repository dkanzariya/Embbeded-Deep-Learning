        "Let's set up data generators that will read pictures in our source folders, convert them to `float32` tensors, and feed them (with their labels) to our network. We'll have one generator for the training images and one for the validation images. Our generators will yield batches of images of size 300x300 and their labels (binary).\n",

        "As you may already know, data that goes into neural networks should usually be normalized in some way to make it more amenable to processing by the network. (It is uncommon to feed raw pixels into a convnet.) In our case, we will preprocess our images by normalizing the pixel values to be in the `[0, 1]` range (originally all values are in the `[0, 255]` range).\n",

This `ImageDataGenerator` class allows you to instantiate generators of augmented image batches (and their labels) via `.flow(data, labels)` or `.flow_from_directory(directory)`. These generators can then be used with the Keras model methods that accept data generators as inputs: `fit_generator`, `evaluate_generator`, and `predict_generator`."
